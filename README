Prints:

----------Wires Array----------
Number of wires: total num of wires in hash table
**********[position in hashtable]**********
----->NAME = | name of wire |
--->ccs num is %d: | name of ccs (component)| 
---> constant  = -1(no constant value), 0(1'b0), 1(1'b1)-> for assign statement
--->assign connections num = %d : | name of assigned connection -- type| (type=0=io type=1=wire) 






----------Ios Array----------
Number of ios: total num of ios in hash table
**********[position in hashtable]**********
----->NAME = | io name --type| (type=0=primary_input type=1=primary_output)
--->ccs num is %d: | name of ccs (component)| 
---> constant  = -1(no constant value), 0(1'b0), 1(1'b1)-> for assign statement
--->assign connections num = = %d : | name of assigned connection -- type| (type=0=io type=1=wire )



----------Gates Array----------
Number of gates: total num of gates in hash table
**********[position in hashtable]**********
-----> NAME = | gate name | 
--->pins num is %d: | each pin name| 

*for dff_x1 the pin num will be always 4 for pins D,CK,Q,Qn and 
in the | each pin name|  there will be either 3 or 4 depending 
on how many of them are connected




----------Components Array----------
Number of components: total num of components in hash table
**********[position in hashtable]**********
----->NAME = | component name | 
---> Gate type: gate type for the component
--->pins num is %d: | type = name |


*|type = name|--> type can be wire or io and name is the name of the pin(wire/io)
If an element is in both ios and wires it will be shown twice, 
BUT it will be added one time in pins num.

type can also be not a wire/io but a constant =1'b0/1'b1

*for dff_x1 types if the component has only 3/4 used pins 
print | - |  in the unconnected port
